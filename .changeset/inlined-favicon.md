Fix the favicon for a theme whose mark a bundler inlines as a `data:` URI (Vite does for files under 4 KB, as with `ux-builder-databricks`): `ThemeProvider` cut the URI at its first quote or bracket, so the tab showed no icon or a broken one. The audit now reads the URI whole too, and checks the favicon on the provider's element rather than a `data-theme` that the app's `index.html` puts on `<html>`, as the starter does.
