Interaction and IA rules, a blueprint check, and audit checks for them (FEAT-008).

- `@ux-builder/ui`: 29 interaction and IA rules (navigation by size class, modals, safeguards on destructive actions, states, emphasis, embedded views), each in the SDK's own words with links to Apple's HIG, Material 3, WCAG 2.2 and the WAI-ARIA APG, plus 8 recipes. They are in `catalogue.json` (`interaction`) and `AGENTS.md`. The new entry point `@ux-builder/ui/blueprint` exports `rulesFor`, `checkBlueprint`, `blueprintSchema`, `findRecipes` and `skeleton`. The new command `ux-builder-blueprint` has `init` and `check`, which checks an `app.blueprint.json` against the rules.
- `@ux-builder/audit`: five new checks, warnings for this minor release: `one-modal`, `modal-contract`, `one-primary-action`, `nav-per-breakpoint` (with `--width`) and `line-length`. Their findings carry `ruleId` and `sources`. `--write-baseline` and `--baseline` let an existing app fail only on new findings; findings that are fixed are listed as resolved.
- `@ux-builder/mcp`: five new tools, `get_rules`, `list_recipes`, `get_recipe`, `get_blueprint_schema` and `check_blueprint`. The guidance states the plan, check, build, lint and audit loop.
- `@ux-builder/create-app`: a new app gets `app.blueprint.json`, a `check:blueprint` script and a CI step for it. `--blueprint <file>` starts from your own plan, and a plan with an error is refused.
